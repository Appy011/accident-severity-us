# Determining Severity of Vehicle Collisions in the U.S.

Exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development of nationwide dataset on U.S. car accidents.

## Description

The goal of this project is to investigate trends in U.S. car accidents and how it can be utilized to develop a machine learning classification model that will predict the likely severity of collision if it were to occur in a particular city. The severity is quantified with a range of 1 to 4 (1 being the least severe or least impact).



## Data Source

The dataset is a nationwide traffic accident record of 49 U.S. states obtained from Sobhan Moosavi, et. al., researchers from Cornell University who conducted a study on traffic accidents in the country. It initially has 49 features and 2,974,335 data points. You can find it [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents).
